# Project 1: Book Recommendation System
## Overview:
Developed a sophisticated book recommendation system aimed at providing personalized reading suggestions based on user preferences. Using Python, I meticulously curated a dataset by selecting books rated by a substantial user base of at least 100 readers, focusing on users who had rated a minimum of 50 books to ensure robust interaction data.

## Technical Details:

- Data Preparation: The dataset was structured into a pivot table format, with users as rows and books as columns, and missing values were strategically filled with zeros.
- Similarity Calculation: Employed cosine similarity to construct a user-user similarity matrix.
- Recommendation Engine: Suggested top-rated books aligned with the preferences of similar users.
- Deployment: Deployed using Streamlit, with a user-friendly interface enriched with visual elements such as background images.
## Outcome:
This project underscores the application of advanced data analytics to deliver effective and personalized book recommendations, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement in literary pursuits.
